                  "We enlisted Daniel as a designer for our CNC product,
                  partially uncertain of its full structure.
                  <br />
                  Regardless, Dan intuitively brought all our ideas to life with
                  little guidance.
                  <br />
                  Daniel's design taste is innovative and truly exquisite,
                  exceeding our expectations.
                  <br />
                  But what's most impressive is his remarkably seamless
                  communication skills and thoughtful approach.
                  <br />
                  It was a delight working with the young man and we look
                  forward to partnering with him in the foreseeable future."
